# Design patterns: solutions for solving common problems

### Types of design patterns
There are three main types of design patterns:
#### 1- Structural design pattern: 
Describes how objects are composed and combined to form larger structures. 

Examples of structural design patterns include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Facade.

#### 2- Behavioral design pattern: 
Describes how objects communicate with each other. 

Examples of behavioral design patterns are Delegation, Strategy and Observer.

#### 3- Creational design pattern: Describes how to create or instantiate objects.

Examples of creational patterns are Builder, Singleton and Prototype.


## ✔️ Model-View-Controller Pattern

The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates objects into three distinct types. Yep, you guessed it: the three types are models, views and controllers!

## Delegation Pattern

The delegation pattern enables an object to use another “helper” object to provide data or perform a task rather than do the task itself. 

This pattern has three parts:

## Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable objects that can be set or switched at runtime.

This pattern has three parts:
