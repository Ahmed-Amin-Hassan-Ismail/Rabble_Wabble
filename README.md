# Design patterns: solutions for solving common problems

### Types of design patterns
There are three main types of design patterns:
#### 1- Structural design pattern: 
Describes how objects are composed and combined to form larger structures. 

Examples of structural design patterns include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Facade.

#### 2- Behavioral design pattern: 
Describes how objects communicate with each other. 

Examples of behavioral design patterns are Delegation, Strategy and Observer.

#### 3- Creational design pattern: Describes how to create or instantiate objects.

Examples of creational patterns are Builder, Singleton and Prototype.


## ✔️ Model-View-Controller Pattern

The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates objects into three distinct types. Yep, you guessed it 

the three types are models, views and controllers!

## ☀︎ Delegation Pattern

The delegation pattern enables an object to use another “helper” object to provide data or perform a task rather than do the task itself. 

This pattern has three parts:

## ☼ Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable objects that can be set or switched at runtime.

This pattern has three parts:

## ☽ Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern restricts a class to only one instance. Every reference to the class refers to the same underlying instance. 

This pattern is extremely common in iOS app development, as Apple makes extensive use of it.

## ☾ Memento Pattern

The memento pattern allows an object to be saved and restored

This pattern has three parts:

## ☂︎ Builder Pattern

The builder pattern allows you to create complex objects by providing inputs step-by-step, instead of requiring all inputs upfront via an initializer

This pattern involves three main types:
